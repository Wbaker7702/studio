# **App Name**: Block Forge

## Core Features:

- Mining Simulation: Simulate the process of Bitcoin mining, providing users with a visual representation of block solving.
- Pool Connection: Connect to a real Bitcoin mining pool via API to display real-time data such as hashrate, pool difficulty, and user contributions.
- Transaction Viewer: Display a feed of recent Bitcoin transactions from the connected pool, showing transaction IDs, amounts, and timestamps.
- Earnings Estimator: Provide an estimate of potential Bitcoin earnings based on the user's simulated hashrate and the current pool statistics. Use an LLM to help determine which information to include, acting as a tool.
- Block Explorer Integration: Link directly to block explorer websites (e.g., Blockchain.com) for detailed information about specific blocks and transactions.
- Educational Resources: Provide resources on blockchain technology.
- Real-Time Data Display: Show real time price of Bitcoin in USD, EUR and other major currencies

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) to evoke the high-tech nature of Bitcoin mining.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#222222) to provide contrast and a sophisticated feel.
- Accent color: Neon Green (#39FF14) to highlight key data points and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font, giving a techy and scientific feel to all text elements; pair with 'Inter' sans-serif for longer text blocks
- Use outline-style icons related to Bitcoin, mining equipment, and blockchain concepts.
- Emphasize real-time data feeds, with clear sections for mining simulation, pool stats, and transaction viewing.
- Incorporate subtle animations to represent the mining process, such as blocks being solved or data flowing through the system.
